A game framework made in Java! Yay...

It's honestly pretty bad right now with a ton of optimization opportunities I don't have the experience to notice. It doesn't even have Image support.

If you want to add a component, check the Issues. That's where I'll put stuff I want help with. You can also create a fork, if you have something I haven't thought of. Thanks in advance!
